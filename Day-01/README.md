## Why the arrays are so popular in todays world?? OR What are the main advantages of using arrays?
There are main two reaons behind it.
1. Cache-friendliness
2. Random access 


## Data structure:
Container in which we store different kinds of data together in unified manner depending upon requirements.

## How Data Structure varies from Data Type:
We already have learned about data structure. Many times, what happens is that people get confused between data type and data structure. So let’s see a few differences between data type and data structure to make it clear.

## Classification of Data Structure: 
Data structure has many different uses in our daily life. There are many different data structures that are used to solve different mathematical and logical problems. By using data structure, one can organize and process a very large amount of data in a relatively short period. Let’s look at different data structures that are used in different situations.

- <b>Linear data structure:</b><br> Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
  - <b>Static data structure:</b> <br> Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
An example of this data structure is an array.
  - <b>Dynamic data structure:</b> <br> In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.
- <b> Non-linear data structure: </b> <br> Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.

## Arrays:
An array is a linear data structure and it is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together in one place. It allows the processing of a large amount of data in a relatively short period. The first element of the array is indexed by a subscript of 0. There are different operations possible in an array, like Searching, Sorting, Inserting, Traversing, Reversing, and Deleting.

- Arrays use an index-based data structure which helps to identify each of the elements in an array easily using the index.
- If a user wants to store multiple values of the same data type, then the array can be utilized efficiently.
- An array can also handle complex data structures by storing data in a two-dimensional array.
- An array is also used to implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
- The search process in an array can be done very easily.

## Linked list: 
A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image: 

- A linked list uses extra memory to store links.
- During initialization of linked list, there is no need to know the size of the elements.
- Linked lists are used to implement stacks, queues, graphs, etc.
- The first node of the linked list is called the Head.
- The next pointer of the last node always points to NULL.
- In linked list, insertion and deletion is possible easily.
- Each node of the linked list consists of a pointer/link which is the address of the next node.
- Linked list can shrink or grow at any point in time easily.

### Types of linked list:

- Singly-linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular linked list
- Doubly circular linked list
